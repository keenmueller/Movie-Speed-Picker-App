# Movie Speed Picker
Android project that will display a list of movies and thier information after selecting a list of criteria.
The API that I used to create this app is from themoviedb.org
More information about the API can be found at their website.

## Version 1

#### Home Screen
The home screen shows three different categories to choose from:
- Genre
- Rating (based on Motion Picture Association of America)
- Length

The idea of the app was to select a popular movie as quickly as possible based on a small list of criteria.
