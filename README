Android project that will display a list of movies and thier information after selecting a list of criteria.

Version 1 is up and running, I will update the readme as soon as I figure out how to include screenshots of the working project

To use the API please go to themoviedb.org for additional information

The idea of the app was to select a popular movie as quickly as possible based on a small list of criteria.
