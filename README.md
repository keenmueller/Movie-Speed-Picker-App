# Movie Speed Picker
Android project that will display a list of movies and thier information after selecting a list of criteria.
The API that I used to create this app is from themoviedb.org
More information about the API can be found at their website.

## Version 1

### Home Screen
The home screen shows three different categories to choose from:
- Genre
- Rating (based on Motion Picture Association of America)
- Length

</p>

After selecting the desired settings from the dropdown, you just need to click the start search button and it will take you to the "List View"

The idea of the app was to select a popular movie as quickly as possible based on a small list of criteria.
